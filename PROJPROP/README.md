# "Stranger Than Friends": The Project Proposal
## The Fan Immersion and Connection of a Show and Its "Ships" Through Music

### Our Logo

### Description
Our website plans to share with you the nature of a specific theoretical couple pairing (also known as "Byler"), derived from a TV show titled "Stranger Things", through music and all of its elements: melody, lyrics, tempo, and even just first-hand vibes! Whether it be modern music that shares similar sentiments and heartfelt feelings of the characters, or songs that stay true to the show's timeline---hitting fans in their feels of nostalgia or immersion into the fictional universe, we are sure to handpick only the best of the best that will surely keep you hooked for more. We have been long time avid fans of the television show, as well as music geeks, which brought us to the notion to combine our interests into a project idea that would be bound to constantly fuel us with productivity and dedication in completing the project up until our last quarter. 

### Webpage Breakdown
Through the entrance of the main page, you (the user) will be able to navigate through five webpages:

**Page 1 (Will's Mixtape):** This page will provide a compilation of songs relating to the character's challenges, situations, and the point of view he experiences in the show; mainly surfing onto the main idea of *things the character wishes he could say.* This will also be accompanied by a few brief explanations and connections from the songs to the character and his timeline.
There will be two compilations organized by date release (of the songs): (a) A modern mix from the decades (2020s-2010s), and; (b) A nostalgic mix dedicated to the songs released during the timeline of the character (1980s-2000s). Despite the decades not being divided evenly, this decision was made to keep similar music styles together, ensuring consistency and smoother listening experiences.

**Page 2 (Mike's Mixtape):** Similar to Page 1, Page 2 also plans to follow an identical pattern, only with a different character in place, which entails new emotions and experiences to convert into equally meaningful song choices.

**Page 3 (Their Past and Present):** This time, Page 3 will involve songs that discuss the *dynamic of the two characters* as a whole, compared to the two mixtapes where each character was fully described in depth. The songs will be organized into two compilations via the characters' intervals of their growth and development arcs: (a) a mix describing their dynamic as kids (called "Miwi", seasons 1-2), and; (b) a mix describing their dynamic as adolescents/teenagers (called "Byler", seasons 3-5). The songs to be included in the compilations will strictly follow songs with release dates only matching the characters' timelines (mainly 1980's-2000's music). This will be followed by descriptions to bring the character themes and their lore to proper light.

**Page 4 (Top Picks):** Page 4 will delve into the characters' overall (top 3) favorite artists and songs, acting as a "Hall of Fame". These top artists and songs will be determined through how much a song/artist is relatable to the character's situation, or if their favourite songs/artists have been made known as a fact/canon in the show.

**Page 5 (Their Lore):** The last webpage (5) will provide a brief, beginner-friendly introduction to the lore of the two characters, and how they came to be. After each description of their standing relationship during each season, there will also be seasonal picks---where a single song is selected for each season of the series to match and describe their dynamic during that specific season. 

**References page:** Our references and sources will be accessible through a hyperlink located in the footer of each webpage, neatly compiled and properly cited using APA citation formatting.

### Incorporating JavaScript
We plan to use JS by forming an array of the playlists, which will make it easier to arrange, condense and embed all of the songs in the website. This also paves the way to possibly add shuffle modes and other extra interactive elements.

### Notes
* The favicon (Logo) and tab title ("Stranger Than Friends) will remain the same across all webpages.
